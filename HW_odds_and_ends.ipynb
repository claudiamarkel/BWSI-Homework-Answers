    "Let's pretend we were conducting a survey of favorite foods. Each participant is asked to list their favorite foods along with its category (e.g. dessert, snack, fruit). The food and category are separated by a colon, and each food-category pair is separated by a comma like so\n",
    "\n",
    "```food: category, food: category, food: category, ... ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this survey are stored in a text file, `results.txt`, giving us a great opportunity to practice our file reading skills!\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to write a function called `get_most_popular_foods` that takes a file path of survey results and returns the most common response for each food category in the form of a dictionary where the keys are the food categories and the values are the most common food of that type. If there is a tie, return the food that comes first alphabetically. Note, we don't know which food categories will be given before reading the file.\n",

    "So, if we had data in the file `example.txt` with the contents below\n",
